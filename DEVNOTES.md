The general idea is that London is going to be hit by a nuclear strike when World War III starts. (Keep in mind, the game was written during the mid-1980s when the fear of nuclear armageddon was quite a bit more pronounced than it is today.) The player must escape before that happens. "Escape" will mean entering a portal to another dimension; this other dimension apparently being tied to historical events regarding atomic or nuclear detonations.

The nuclear strike will occur at 4 PM. The game itself starts at 3:30 PM. Time will move forward by fifteen seconds for each turn. This means four turns will equal one minute.

The above sets the overall context for the starting area. The starting area will need a geography to walk around in for these events. The geography will be a constrained part of Kensington Gardens.
