The general idea is that London is going to be hit by a nuclear strike when World War III starts. (Keep in mind, the game was written during the mid-1980s when the fear of nuclear armageddon was quite a bit more pronounced than it is today.) The player must escape before that happens. "Escape" will mean entering a portal to another dimension; this other dimension apparently being tied to historical events regarding atomic or nuclear detonations.

The nuclear strike will occur at 4 PM. The game itself starts at 3:30 PM. Time will move forward by fifteen seconds for each turn. This means four turns will equal one minute.

The above sets the overall context for the starting area. The starting area will need a geography to walk around in for these events. The geography will be a constrained part of Kensington Gardens.

The player character won't know the the apocalypse is approaching. But they will get clues that something odd is happening. Ultimately those clues will tell the player character to be at a certain place at a certain time, although not really indicating why or what to do once there. In the original _Trinity_, the player basically just did what the game indicated because ... well, because why not? That's how the game is played. But in this remythologized version, the goal was to make it more clear why the player character would actually do any of this stuff.

In the original _Trinity_, the ultimate goal is that the player has to get to Long Water at 4:00 as this is where the dimensional portal will be found. That's stiil pretty much the case in this remythologized version although the Long Water area has been expanded a bit to include a few more locations. Still the player has to first get to Long Water and the path to it will be blocked by some obstruction in the grassy area.

How does the player get guided to Long Water in the first place, however?

Before answering that, this leads to an interesting condition. The player may try to go to Long Water, just in the general course of exploring, before they realize the signficance of Long Water to their adventure. So there has to be a way to coditionalize the response to hitting the Long Water barrier. But, at the moment, there is no much condition to hook onto.

So now let's consider: how does the player get guided to Long Water?

This gets to an involved series of related events. First, the player will encounter an old woman in Lancaster Gate. This woman will be struggling with an umbrella. The umbrella will eventually be caught in the wind and blown into a tree. The player should try to recover this umbrella, ostensibly to give it back to the woman. So far, this is exactly what happens in the original _Trinity_. The umbrella ends up being a needed item in order to get to Long Water.

Another item needed to get to Long Water in the original version of the game was a perambulator. This was just something that the player stumbled across. In the remythologized version, however, this perambulator will be something that the old woman mentions to the player. In fact, the player won't be able to find the pram until the woman mentions it. Once the woman does mention the pram, it will be found in Black Lion Gate.

Crucially, when the player then locates the pram, inside that pram will be a note. The note will say "Long Water. 4:00." The player does get such a note in the original _Trinity_ although it's not in the pram. You actually get that information from a paper bird that you find floating. This always felt way too contrived for me. In the remythologized version, I wanted to add something else. The note will also say "Rebecca's life depends on it!" Who is Rebecca? Well, this would be protagonist's child. Obviously this gives incentive to at least figure out what's going on.

For the final cluing to take place, however, the encounter with the old woman is crucial. Two events must happen as a result of the player ending up in Lancaster Gate: the umbrella must be blown into the tree (so that the player can get it) and the woman must mention her lost pram (so the player can find the note). The player will be gated from leaving Lancaster Gate until those two events happen. Once those two events happen, the old woman will leave Lancaster Gate.

Note that with all of this, we do finally get the condition that might determine how being blocked from Long Water is conveyed to the player. If the player tries to go to Long Water before seeing the note, they'll have no idea of the greater significance of the location. However, the player has seen the note, it would be nice to show a different response to being blocked.

I'll add one more note here. Ultimately the player does need the umbrella. They don't have to get the umbrella before the old woman leaves Lancaster Gate, but the umbrella does have to be capable of being taken before the woman leaves. But how does the player take it since it gets blown up into a tree. In the original _Trinity_ the way to do this was by throwing a soccer ball at it. And that's something I'll keep in this version as well.

All of this also points to the need to model the player character's (and the player's) knowledge of the world. For example, with the stuck umbrella, a check can be made if the player has seen the soccer ball. This will trigger a clue about using the ball to dislodge the umbrella. Likewise, there's the pram. The player will not be aware of this at all when the game starts. But once the woman mentions it, the player will become aware that such an object exists. The same applies to the knowledge of the note which will make the player (and player character) think about Long Water a bit differently.
