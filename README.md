# Trinity Remythologized

At a non-descript spot way out in the New Mexico desert between Socorro and Alamogordo, approximately latitude 33 degrees north, longitude 106 degrees west, at 5:30 in the morning on 16 July 1945, the first atomic bomb was detonated, yielding an explosion equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT.

That event, along with decades of nuclear proliferation, were what led [Brian Moriarty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Moriarty) to write the text adventure game called [Trinity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(video_game)>) in 1986.

The game was published by [Infocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom). The rights to this game are theoretically still held by [Activision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision), who acquired Infocom in 1996.

My "remythologized" work is in no way an attempt to claim priority nor original authorship, hence providing the above attribution information. What I'm doing here is exactly what it sounds like: an attempt to mythologize again (but in a new way) what is arguably one of the most popular of Infocom's titles.

There is quite a mythology that has built up around the game but I have found there are many ways to look at the story the provides around its core gameplay mechanics, which allows for a very different outlook and perpsective. This was something I had explored in two contexts:

- [Moral Premise and Gaming](https://intfiction.org/t/moral-premise-and-gaming/1484)
- [Moral Premise: Trinity Reimagined](https://intfiction.org/t/moral-premise-trinity-reimagined/1496)

In fact, of all of Infocom's games, I've found _Trinity_ to be the one that allows for the most experimentation and exploration around not just its core themes but its particular implementation.

I should note that I'm creating this work in a modern interactive fiction design system known as [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/).
